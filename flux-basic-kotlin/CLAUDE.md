# Project Guidelines

## Fluxzero Guidelines Required to Follow
**CRITICAL: Before starting any task, you MUST follow all guidance in `.fluxzero/agents/index.md`.**

## Mandatory Read Order (Do Not Skip)
1. `.fluxzero/agents/index.md`
2. `.fluxzero/agents/rules/guidelines.md`
3. `.fluxzero/agents/rules/runtime-interaction.md`
4. Task-specific manuals selected via the decision tree in `guidelines.md`

## Execution Protocol (Mandatory)
For every non-trivial task, the agent MUST:
1. Confirm applicable non-negotiable rules.
2. Implement changes.
3. Add/update tests for behavior changes.
4. Run relevant tests.
5. Perform a final refactor/readability pass if task had retries/complexity.
6. Report compliance checks in final output.
