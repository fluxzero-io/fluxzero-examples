## Guideline Instructions

Check folder `.aiassistant/rules` in the project root for the following files:

- `guidelines.md`: common guidelines for Fluxzero projects.
- `fluxzero.md`: philosophy of Fluxzero.
- `code-samples.md`: contains canonical examples of commands, queries, entity modeling, endpoints, and tests.
- `fluxzero-fqns-grouped.txt`: contains java imports. Always check this, never make up imports.

Use these as the **source of truth**. Do not generalize or guess patterns that differ from these files.
