# Fluxzero Examples

A collection of example projects demonstrating the capabilities of the [Fluxzero SDK](https://fluxzero.io). These examples serve as both learning resources and project templates for the Fluxzero CLI (`fz init`).

## 🚀 Available Examples

### [`flux-basic-java`](./flux-basic-java/)
Basic Java project demonstrating fundamental Fluxzero concepts. Shows minimal setup and core SDK usage patterns.

**Features:**
- Basic project structure
- Essential Fluxzero components
- Ready-to-run configuration

### [`flux-basic-kotlin`](./flux-basic-kotlin/)
Kotlin equivalent of the basic Java example with Kotlin-specific enhancements.

**Features:**
- JDK 21+ support
- Detekt code style enforcement
- IntelliJ IDEA integration with live templates
- Clean Gradle project using `libs.versions.toml`
- Example HTTP requests in `.test/requests`

### [`gamerental`](./gamerental/)
Comprehensive game rental system showcasing advanced Fluxzero features and production-ready patterns.

**Features:**
- 🎯 **Zero-boilerplate command handling** with event sourcing
- 🔍 **Live search & queries** using document store
- ⚖️ **Role-based access control** with JSR-380 validation
- 📦 **Dynamic Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** with error recovery
- 🌐 **Clean Web API** with type-safe handlers
- 🔄 **WebSocket support** for real-time updates
- 🧪 **Comprehensive testing** with Flux Capacitor test framework

## 🛠️ Using Examples with Fluxzero CLI

These examples are automatically packaged with the Fluxzero CLI and can be used to scaffold new projects:

```bash
# List available templates
fz templates list

# Create a new project from an example
fz init --template flux-kotlin-single --name my-app

# Interactive template selection
fz init
```

For more CLI usage information, see the [Fluxzero CLI documentation](https:/fluxzero.io/docs).

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Examples

Each example includes its own README with specific setup and running instructions. Generally:

1. **Prerequisites**: JDK 21+ required for all examples
2. **Build**: Use provided Gradle or Maven configurations (both supported)
3. **Run**: Examples include IntelliJ run configurations or can be started via command line
4. **Test**: Comprehensive test suites demonstrate Fluxzero testing capabilities

## 🤝 Contributing Third-Party Examples

We welcome community contributions! To submit your example:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** your example in a new directory following existing patterns
3. **Include** a comprehensive README documenting your example
4. **Add tests** demonstrating your example's functionality
5. **Submit** a pull request

### Requirements for New Examples

- **Self-contained**: Must be runnable out of the box
- **Well-documented**: Clear README explaining purpose and usage
- **Tested**: Include comprehensive tests
- **Multi-build support**: Must support both Maven and Gradle build systems
- **Template configuration**: Must include `refactor.yaml` to instruct the Fluxzero CLI how to customize the template for users
- **License agreement**: By contributing, you agree that your example will be published under the same license as this repository

```

## 📋 Template Integration

When the Fluxzero CLI builds, it automatically downloads and packages these examples as templates. The build process:

1. Downloads the latest examples from this repository
2. Packages them for CLI distribution
3. Makes them available via `fz templates list` and `fz init`

Template features include:
- **Package name replacement** for Java/Kotlin projects
- **File customization** based on user input and `refactor.yaml` configuration
- **Interactive configuration** during project creation
- **Build system selection** between Maven and Gradle
