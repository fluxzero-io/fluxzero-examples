# 🎮 Game Rental Demo — Powered by Flux Capacitor

This repository demonstrates how to build a clean, reactive, and fully testable application using the [Flux Capacitor](https://flux-capacitor.io) Java client.

You'll find a complete, production-like system for managing and renting games, showing off:

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Zero-Boilerplate Command Handling
Send commands to an **event-sourced** aggregate with almost no glue code:

```java
FluxCapacitor.sendCommand(new RegisterGame(...));
```

The game entity handles and validates updates via `@Apply` and `@AssertLegal`, no other frameworks or magic base classes required.

---

### 🔍 Live Search & Queries
Use the **document store** for indexed queries:

- `FindGames` searches game titles/tags.
- `GetGameStats` computes **faceted search statistics** like genre distribution.

---

### ⚖️ Constraints, Roles, and Guardrails
All game commands are checked for:

- ✋ Violations (via JSR-380 annotations)
- 🔒 Required roles (`@RequiresRole`)
- 🧩 Business rules (`@AssertLegal`)

If a command is invalid, a detailed error is returned automatically.

---

### 📦 Dynamic DLQ & Error Recovery

The `FlakyGameAnnouncer` is intentionally unstable — it sometimes throws exceptions during event handling.  
When this happens, Flux automatically logs the error, including a correlation to the **causing message**, enabling a **Dynamic Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.

The `CorrectingGameAnnouncer` listens to the error log and reacts accordingly by correcting the error.

All of this is transparent, testable, and fully integrated into the message tracking system.

---

### 🌐 Clean Web API with Zero boilerplate
Use `@HandleGet`, `@HandlePost`, and friends to expose endpoints like:

- `POST /games` → registers a new game
- `GET /games?term=puzzle` → search
- `POST /games/{gameId}/rent` → rent a game
- `POST /games/{gameId}/return` → return a game

Handlers are type-safe and declarative — no need for annotations like `@RestController` or manual JSON parsing.

---

### 🔄 WebSockets and Live Updates
Clients can open a **WebSocket** connection (via `GameSocket`) to receive real-time updates whenever a new game is added.

---

### 🧪 Ultra-Compact Tests
Test all flows — commands, queries, events, errors, and web requests — using the Flux Capacitor testing framework.

No mocks, no fakes. Just:

```java
testFixture.whenPost("/games", "/game/game-details.json")
           .expectResult(GameId.class)
           .expectEvents(RegisterGame.class);
```

Fixtures auto-fill path params and simulate end-to-end behavior across messaging layers.

## 🛠️ Running the App

This sample is built with **Spring Boot**, but it works equally well without it. To run:

`Flux test + proxy + app`

This launches an in-memory Flux Capacitor test platform as well as the game rental app.

To run tests:

`All tests`

## 🤔 Why Flux Capacitor?

Because message-driven, event-sourced, location-transparent systems shouldn’t be this hard.

Flux Capacitor makes it:

- **Concise**: No boilerplate aggregates or DTOs
- **Safe**: Built-in validation, retry, DLQ, snapshots
- **Flexible**: Web, CLI, schedule, WebSocket, documents — all unified
- **Testable**: Verify behavior through message effects, not mocks
