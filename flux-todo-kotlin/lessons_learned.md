# Lessons Learned: Building a FluxZero Application

## What I Learned About FluxZero

### Core Architecture Patterns
1. **Event Sourcing with Aggregates**: FluxZero uses `@Aggregate` annotation with configurable persistence strategies (searchable, eventSourced). The framework handles state reconstruction from events automatically.

2. **Command/Query Separation**:
   - Commands implement `Request<T>` interface and use `@HandleCommand`
   - Queries also implement `Request<T>` with `@HandleQuery`
   - The `Request<T>` interface provides type safety for return values

3. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - `@AssertLegal` methods run before state changes
   - `@Apply` methods handle state mutations
   - Returning `null` from a command deletes the aggregate

4. **Self-Handling Pattern**: Commands and queries can contain their own handler logic using `@TrackSelf`, making the code more cohesive.

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Type Inference Issues
```kotlin
// Had to explicitly specify type parameter
Fluxzero.loadAggregate<TodoItem>(todoId)  // Required explicit type
```
The Kotlin compiler couldn't infer the aggregate type in some cases.

### 2. Test Infrastructure Complexity
The test setup required understanding multiple components:
- TestServer for FluxZero backend
- ProxyServer for HTTP gateway
- Spring Boot integration
- LocalClient vs remote configuration

### 3. Import Confusion
Different packages had similar-sounding classes:
- `io.fluxzero.sdk.tracking.handling.Request` vs other Request types
- Various annotation packages spread across different modules

### 4. Search/Query Implementation Gap
List queries returned empty lists with comments like "Proper search requires indexing configuration" - the actual implementation details for searchable aggregates weren't clear from examples.

## Missing Documentation/Context

### 1. **Search Index Configuration**
- How to actually query searchable aggregates
- Index configuration for filtering and sorting
- Pagination implementation details

### 2. **Event Store Mechanics**
- How events are persisted and replayed
- Snapshot frequency optimization
- Event versioning and migration strategies

### 3. **Testing Best Practices**
- When to use JSON fixtures vs programmatic test data
- How to test time-dependent logic properly
- Mocking external dependencies in FluxZero context

### 4. **Production Configuration**
- Connection to actual FluxZero servers (not LocalClient)
- Authentication and authorization patterns beyond `@RequiresRole`
- Monitoring and observability setup

### 5. **Advanced Patterns**
- Sagas and long-running workflows
- Event projections and read models
- Handling eventual consistency

## What I Need From You for Flawless FluxZero Development

### 1. **Complete Working Example**
A reference application showing:
- Full CRUD with working search/filtering
- Production-ready configuration
- Proper error handling patterns
- Integration with external services

### 2. **FluxZero Cheat Sheet**
Quick reference for:
- All annotations and their exact purposes
- Import statements for common scenarios
- Command/Query/Event naming conventions
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### 3. **Testing Guidelines**
- Preferred testing patterns for FluxZero
- How to structure test data (JSON vs code)
- Integration vs unit testing boundaries
- Performance testing approaches

### 4. **Project Template**
A starter template with:
- Correct gradle/maven configuration
- Pre-configured Spring Boot integration
- Working test setup
- Linting rules that match FluxZero conventions

### 5. **Debugging Guide**
- Common error messages and their solutions
- How to inspect event streams
- Debugging aggregate state issues
- Troubleshooting command/query routing

### 6. **Architecture Decision Records**
- When to use event sourcing vs state storage
- How to design aggregate boundaries
- Command vs Event naming strategies
- When to use `@TrackSelf` vs separate handlers

## Specific Technical Clarifications Needed

1. **Aggregate Loading**: When exactly is the type parameter required for `loadAggregate<T>()`?

2. **Handler Registration**: How does FluxZero discover and register handlers? Spring component scanning?

3. **Transaction Boundaries**: How are transactions managed across command handlers?

4. **Error Recovery**: What happens when an event handler fails? How is consistency maintained?

5. **Testing Isolation**: How does TestFixture ensure test isolation? Are aggregates cleared between tests?

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - What's the overhead of event sourcing?
   - When to use snapshots?
   - How to optimize query performance?

## Recommendations for Documentation

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple examples, then layer complexity
2. **Complete Code Samples**: Every example should be runnable
3. **Common Patterns Cookbook**: Recipes for typical scenarios
4. **Migration Guide**: How to evolve aggregates and events over time
5. **Troubleshooting Section**: Common issues and their solutions

## What Worked Well

1. The `TestFixture` API is intuitive once understood
2. The command/query pattern with `Request<T>` provides excellent type safety
3. Business rule validation with `@AssertLegal` is clean and declarative
4. The builder pattern for aggregates works well with Kotlin data classes

By providing these materials and clarifications, you would enable me to create FluxZero applications with confidence, avoiding the trial-and-error approach I had to use during this implementation.
